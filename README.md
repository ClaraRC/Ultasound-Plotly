# Guidelines for the use of html files containing SSANOVA lingual splines for Catalan  two-consonant sequences
The folders named Speaker DR, ES, IM, JU and RO include several html files for each Catalan speaker each of which allows visualizing SSANOVA lingual splines for a number of consonant sequences sharing a common ‘target’ consonant, i.e., the consonant appearing in the file name.  These files will appear on the screen after clicking on the subject’s folder. In order to access a file you can either download it into your computer or else go to https://htmlpreview.github.io/ and paste the file path into the empty cell.
 All files except for K2 allow visualizing splines for several heterosyllabic C#C sequences with a given target consonant, which may appear as C1 in coda position and as C2 in onset position. Thus, for example, if you click on the file labelled ‘Cons S’ you will be able to see spline data for the sequences /sl/ (SL), /st/ (ST), /sn/ (SN), /sp/ (SP), /sɲ/ (SNY) and /sk/ (SK) as well as for the reverse clusters  /ls/ (LS), /ts/ (TS), /ns/ (NS), /ps/ (PS), /ɲs/ (NYS) and /ks/ (KS). The target consonants are /p/ (P), /t/ (T), /n/ (N), /l/ (L), /s/ (S), /r/ (R), NY (/ɲ/), TX (/tʃ/) and /k, g/ (K1); the C#C sequences appearing in the file labeled FRICATIVE SEQUENCES are /s#s/, /s#ʃ/, /ʃ#s/ and /ʃ#ʃ/. In the file K2, you can view lingual splines for heterosyllabic velar+liquid and liquid+velar combinations, as well as for syllable-onset clusters with a velar C1 and C2=/l/ or C2=/ɾ/ which appear enclosed within parentheses on the left of the graph.
Inside each file the target consonant is always highligthed in boldface. Lingual configuration data for all C#C sequences include splines computed at 5 time points (C1 on, C1 mp, C1 off, C2 mp, C2 off) if there is no burst or opening period at the offset of C1, or else at 6 time points (C1 on, C1 mp, C1 off, C2 on, C2 mp, C2 off) if this period is available. Here are some instructions for use. 
(a) You can view the SSANOVA lingual splines for a given cluster at all 5 or 6 time points by clicking on any of the corresponding button appearing on the left of the graph. Thus, if you open the file for consonant S and click on the button ‘SL’, you will see the splines for the cluster /sl/ at C1 onset (SL-C1 on), at C1 midpoint (SL-C1 mp) and at all succesive time points. You can display the splines in different colours by clicking on the ‘One colour per time point’ button (in this case the splines for C1 will appear in different shades of blue and the splines for C2 in different shades of red), or else in a single colour whether it be black by clicking on the ‘Single colour splines’ or another colour by clicking on ‘One colour per group’. Information about xy location, C#C sequence and time point may be obtained by placing the cursor anywhere on a given spline. 
	(b) You can view the splines for the target consonant in all sequences at a given time point by clicking on any of the buttons ‘Target C1 on’, ‘Target C1 mp’, etc. placed above the graph. Thus, for example, if you open the file for consonant S and click on ‘Target C1 on’, the splines at C1=/s/ onset for /sl/ (SL), /st/ (ST), /sn/ (SN), /sp/ (SP), /sɲ/ (SNY) and /sk/ (SK) should appear on the graph. On the other hand,  if you click on ‘Target C2 mp’ you should be able to see the splines at C2=/s/ midpoint for /ls/ (LS), /ts/ (TS), /ns/ (NS), /ps/ (PS), /ɲs/ (NYS) and /ks/ (KS). Again you can have all splines in the same colour by clicking on ‘Single colour splines’ or ‘One colour per time point’ or in different colours by clicking on ‘One colour per group’.
 (c) You can view the splines for the non-target consonants (i.e., all contextual consonants appearing next to the target consonant and thus /l/ L, /t/ T, /n/ N, /p/ P, /ɲ/ NY and /k/ K in the case of target S) at a given time point by clicking on any of the buttons ‘Non-target C1 on’, ‘Non-target C1 mp’, etc. Colours may be changed as in (b).
You can view a subset of the splines being displayed by removing one or more splines by just clicking on the labels appearing on the right of the graph. There other things that you can do with the ‘zoom’, ‘pan’, ‘autoscale’  and ‘reset axes’ icons appearing on the screen above the uppermost buttons.
